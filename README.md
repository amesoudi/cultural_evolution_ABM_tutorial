# Simulation models of cultural evolution in R

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/144488138.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/144488138)

This tutorial shows how to create very simple simulation or agent-based models of cultural evolution in R. Currently these are:

* Model 1: Unbiased transmission
* Model 2: Unbiased and biased mutation
* Model 3: Biased transmission (direct/content bias)
* Model 4: Biased transmission (indirect bias)
* Model 5: Biased transmission (conformist bias)
* Model 6: Vertical and horizontal transmission
* Model 7: Migration
* Model 8: Blending inheritance
* Model 9: Demography and cultural gain/loss
* Model 10: Polarization
* Model 11: Cultural group selection
* Model 12: Historical dynamics
* Model 13: Social contagion
* Model 14: Social networks
* Model 15: Opinion formation

Each model is contained in a separate RMarkdown (Rmd) file. You can either (i) download each of these Rmd files from https://github.com/amesoudi/cultural_evolution_ABM_tutorial then open them in RStudio or another IDE, executing the code as you read the text, or (ii) read the online version of the tutorial at https://bookdown.org/amesoudi/ABMtutorial_bookdown/ which contains the compiled models with outputs. There is also a pdf version of the entire book on the github page. For maximum learning (and fun), I recommend (i), where you can execute and play around with the code yourself.
